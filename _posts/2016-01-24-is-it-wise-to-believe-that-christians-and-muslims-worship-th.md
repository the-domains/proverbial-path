# Is It Wise to Believe That Christians and Muslims Worship the Same God?

Proverbs tells us that the most crucial element of a wise worldview is having an understanding of, and proper attitude toward, the one who created the world---God. [Proverbs 9:10][0] is one of several verses that tell us "Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"--but is it wisdom if we don't know who this God is that we're fearing? The same verse, for example, goes on to explain that "knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."

Some have stoked controversy recently by claiming that Christians and Muslims worship the same God. Those who make this claim often have noble motives; making peace and avoiding unnecessary conflict are hallmarks of wisdom. But are they correct? And how much ambiguity about God's identity can true Biblical wisdom accept? Proverbs (as with the entire Bible) also has much to say about who God is---his heart, his character, even his name--and we ignore these passages at our peril. 

Nabeel Qureshi from RZIM gives a thoughtful response to the controversy in [this recent blog post][1].
