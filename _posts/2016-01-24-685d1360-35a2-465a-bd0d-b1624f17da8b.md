### [_What Would Jesus Post? Seven Principles Christians Should Follow in Social Media _][0]

It is vitally important for we who identify as Christ-followers to pay attention to social media. I have seen far too much evidence of social media's corrosive effects on the lives of those around me. Loose words and poorly thought-out actions online have ruined relationships, caused offense, and even soured people on faith altogether.

I've also seen much good come out of interactions that took place, in whole or in part, online. People have been drawn back into fellowship by their Facebook friends. Others have delivered encouragement to people in times of need that they wouldn't have known about if not for social media. But social media itself is morally neutral. The ability to interact with others online is a tool, nothing more. Whether it affects people for good or ill depends entirely on how we choose to use it.

If we take seriously Jesus' command in Matthew 22:37-40 to "love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind ... \[and\] love your neighbor as yourself," and if we recognize the power that social media can have both on our own hearts and minds and on our relationships with others, then we need to be asking ourselves such questions as, "Am I honoring God with how I use social media?" "What effect are these sites having on me as a person?" and "How could I use this technology to be a better friend to the people in my life?"  
As important as these questions are, there is still very little discussion of them within the church. That's why I wrote_What Would Jesus Post?_
