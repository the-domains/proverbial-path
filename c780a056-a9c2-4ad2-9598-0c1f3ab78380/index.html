In seven short, succinct, well-researched, and digestible chapters, the author outlines biblical guidelines for social community. I found this book challenging and gently convicting. It’s a great tool for families, church groups, and anyone else looking to set healthy social media boundaries. And while it took me less than an hour to read, I’m going to be thinking about its message for a long time to come—especially when I’m online.</i></p><p>--L.P. (via Amazon) - 5 stars out of 5</p><p><i>In “What Would Jesus Post?”, Wassom seeks out biblical answers and wisdom for using social media. In it, we can answer questions and learn how God designed us to use social media, words, and interact with others. The main thing with social media has to be about how we can glorify God using it. How can we lead others closer to Christ through what we post, and respond to others. Not only is it at our fingertips, but social media brings great power and responsibility. We need to be diligent in how we use it. We can use it to build up the Kingdom of God, but also use it to taint the message through our thoughtless actions. Social media is a tool that is indeed a blessing, but with it comes great responsibility. Brain D. Wassom explores how we can honor God in how we live online, and apply His wisdom to the interactions we have in social media.<br>This book has been a blessing to read. It has been a quick reading, but more importantly a thoughtful read. I love being driven back to God and His Word. God has much to say regarding social media and our interactions with others. How can I use my Facebook accounts for God’s glory? What does it mean to be a “friend”? How can I aim for loyalty in my online friendships, and “be there” for others? This book begins the inward meditation and transformation as we seek to honor God with our very lives and giving Him everything (even social media).<br>I highly recommend this book to anyone. It is a great read, as one begins to seek how they may glorify God in everything. With social media, we need to be discerning. We need to carefully discern our words and actions that go forth. We need to pursue accountability and continue in discerning what we allow to be put before our eyes.</i><br>--Stacey (via Amazon/Booksneeze) - 5 out of 5 stars</p><p><i>"The author is right on point and highlights areas that all Christians need to consider when using social media. Fantastic read, easy to follow and concise. I will be passing this one along to several friends and to the leaders in our church."</i><br>--Tina (via Amazon) - 5 stars out of 5</p><p><i>"Churches with teen groups ought to utilize this book as a discussion starter for the young people whom they serve. Wassom draws concrete examples from Scripture to modern social networking discussion and lays out an understandable path for action. The seven principles seem so basic, and yet are too often forgotten (even by the not-so-young who strive to live a more Scripture-driven life).</i></p><p><i>It is a fast read, but will be one of those texts that I can see referencing for years to come. Especially when my own children, just a couple of years older than Wassom's two, come of age to take forays into the social networking site of their time. At this point, I see this book as a terrific guide to assisting my children in putting into practice these seven principles on a daily basis as they interact face-to-face. (I also see it as a way to check my own behaviors!)"</i><br>--Julianne (via Amazon) - 5 stars out of 5</p><p><i>This book is a great reminder of how uncensored thoughts express on a social media site could hurt us in many ways, i.e., employment, legally, and socially. The seven principles are guidelines to go by when posting anything online, as well as, how we should think before taking action. Wassom, being a lawyer, is still able to speak in layman's terms and makes it enjoyable to read. I think it should be required reading for ages 12+, especially in teen and college groups.</i><br>--B.Goetz (via Amazon) - 5 stars out of 5</p><picture>
